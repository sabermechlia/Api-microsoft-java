# Getting Started with the Microsoft Graph Outlook Mail API and Java

The sample code in this repository is the end result of going through the [Java tutorial on the Outlook Dev Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/rest/java-tutorial). If you go through that tutorial yourself, you should end up with code very similar to this. If you download or fork this repository, you'll need to follow the steps in [Configure the sample](#configure-the-sample) to run it.

> **NOTE:** Looking for the version of this tutorial that used the Outlook API directly instead of Microsoft Graph? Check out the `outlook-api` branch. Note that Microsoft recommends using the Microsoft Graph to access mail, calendar, and contacts. You should use the Outlook APIs directly (via https://outlook.office.com/api) only if you require a feature that is not available on the Graph endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit 8.
- Spring Tool Suite

## Register the app

Head over to https://apps.dev.microsoft.com to quickly get a application ID and password. Click the **Sign in** link and sign in with either your Microsoft account (Outlook.com), or your work or school account (Office 365).

Once you're signed in, click the **Add an app** button. Enter `java-tutorial` for the name and click **Create application**. After the app is created, locate the **Application Secrets** section, and click the **Generate New Password** button. Copy the password now and save it to a safe place. Once you've copied the password, click **Ok**.

Locate the **Platforms** section, and click **Add Platform**. Choose **Web**, then enter `http://localhost:8080/authorize.html` under **Redirect URIs**.

> **NOTE:** The values in **Redirect URIs** are case-sensitive, so be sure to match the case!

Click **Save** to complete the registration. Copy the **Application Id** and save it along with the password you copied earlier. We'll need those values soon.

Here's what the details of your app registration should look like when you are done.

1. If you use an IDE, Right-click the project and choose **Run as**, then **Maven build**.
1. From a console, run **mvn package** and **mvn jetty:run** to start up a server
1. Access `http://localhost:8080`
